These data structures and the <code class=\"language-text\">merge</code> operation also form a Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT). It being a CRDT allows Xi to be used for concurrent editing of text on multiple devices, it can merge edits, including those made offline, between multiple devices and converge on a consistent document that includes all changes.</p>\n<p>Beyond synchronizing text, these data structures and operations allow Xi to handle asynchronous editing of the text from plugins, support undo and redo, and allow incremental updating of editor state and the view based on differences between revisions.</p>\n<p>Many of these data structures and operations have been in Xi for a while but they've recently been heavily overhauled and extended as part of <a href=\"https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/250\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">a project</a> that added multi-device syncing support via the CRDT merge operation. This was done for <a href=\"https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/topaz/+/master/bin/xi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">use on the Fuchsia operating system</a>, where it uses <a href=\"https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/peridot/+/HEAD/docs/ledger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Ledger</a> to synchronize documents between devices.</p>\n<p>What follows is both a description of a data structure for text and a code tour of the <code class=\"language-text\">xi-rope</code> crate. It describes the actual Rust data structures and algorithms used, because the primary novelty and difficulty of this CRDT is in the optimized representation that allows for better time and memory complexity.

It works by sending <em>operations</em> like inserts and deletes between peers and transforming them to apply to the current text. Unfortunately many implementations of OT have a problem where they don't always preserve ordering when text is deleted.</p>\n<p>For example see the following diagram showing 3 peers sending edits between each other ending up in an inconsistent state. The arrows represent operations being sent asynchronously between devices in a peer-to-peer editing system based on OT, with time progressing downward. Whenever an edit is made the operation is sent to all other peers, but due to asynchronous communication they can be arbitrarily delayed. When an operation arrives at a peer it is transformed and applied to the current text. For clarity, not all arrows are shown, but you can imagine that the arrival of missing sends just got delayed past the end of the diagram.</p>\n<p><img src=\"img/tp2.png\" alt=\"TP2 Problem\"></p>\n<p>Acting consistently in cases like this is called having \"Transform Property 2\" (see <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.53.933&#x26;rep=rep1&#x26;type=pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Operational Transformation in Real-Time Group Editors:\nIssues, Algorithms, and Achievements</a> by Sun &#x26; Ellis, 1998). One approach to the problem is to serialize all edits through a central server which does all the transformation. With this approach, the ordering relative to deleted text may not be preserved, but at least all clients will converge to the same state. This is what Google Docs and many other collaborative editing systems do.</p>\n<p>Xi avoids this problem by using \"tombstones\" (see <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.103.2679&#x26;rep=rep1&#x26;type=pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Tombstone Transformation Functions for Ensuring Consistency in Collaborative Editing Systems</a>), which leave deleted characters in the representation so that ordering can be preserved. This will be described in detail later.</p>\n<h2 id=\"representation\"><a href=\"#representation\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Representation</h2>\n<p>The conceptual representation described in <a href=\"/static/crdt-4fd168c29a50954708982e0484333a29.md\"><code class=\"language-text\">crdt.md</code></a> would be very inefficient to use directly. If we had to store an ID and ordering edges for each character and reconstruct the current text via topological sort every time we wanted to know what the current text is, Xi would be incredibly slow and would use much more memory than is necessary.</p>\n<p>Instead, we use a representation that allows all the operations we care about to be fast. We also take advantage of the typical patterns of text document usage to make the representation more memory efficient for common cases.</p>\n<p>The key optimization that shapes everything else is to avoid using IDs for characters or storing ordering edges explicitly. Instead, we represent the identity of characters implicitly by their position in the current text. But then how do we reference them in our revision history? If we use indices into the current text, they will get outdated by changes. We could rewrite all the indices in the history every time we made an edit, but that would be terribly inefficient. Instead the set of inserted characters in every revision is treated as a <em>coordinate transform</em> for the older revisions. In order to find the character referred to by an older revision you have to transform the indices it uses based on the insertions made after it. This allows us to make our history append-only, leaving the indices referring to the text at the time of the revision.</p>\n<p>That description is almost certainly too vague to be understandable at this point, but don't worry, there will be a full description with diagrams later on.</p>\n<p>Starting from the basic building blocks and proceeding towards the top level CRDT <code class=\"language-text\">Engine</code>, here are all the structures:</p>\n<h3 id=\"rope\"><a href=\"#rope\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Rope</h3>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"rust\"><pre class=\"language-rust\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"token keyword\">pub</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">struct</span> <span class=\"token function\">Rope</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>Arc<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>RopeBody<span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token attribute attr-name\">#[derive(Clone)]</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">struct</span> RopeBody <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">/// Used for efficiently seeking to an index in the tree</span>\n    len<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> usize<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">/// Used for rebalancing</span>\n    height<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> usize<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    val<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> RopeVal<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">enum</span> RopeVal <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">Leaf</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>String<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">Internal</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>Vec<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>Rope<span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> All the Rust code in this document is simplified from the actual implementation so that it still conveys the structure and memory properties of the representation but elides details not necessary to understand the CRDT. See the code or generated docs for the full definitions. For example, the real struct for <code class=\"language-text\">Rope</code> is called <code class=\"language-text\">Node&lt;N: NodeInfo&gt;</code> and is a generic structure not specific to text, that is later instantiated for text as <code class=\"language-text\">pub type Rope = Node&lt;RopeInfo&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>When representing potentially large amounts of text, Xi avoids using <code class=\"language-text\">String</code>s and instead uses a data structure called <code class=\"language-text\">Rope</code>. This is essentially an immutable <code class=\"language-text\">String</code> except many operations that would be <code class=\"language-text\">O(n)</code> with normal strings are instead <code class=\"language-text\">O(log n)</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">O(1)</code>. Some examples of operations like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Copying</li>\n<li>Extracting a substring by index</li>\n<li>Inserting one piece of text in the middle of another producing a new piece of text</li>\n<li>Deleting an interval from a piece of text, producing a new piece of text</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Behind the scenes, <code class=\"language-text\">Rope</code> is an immutable balanced tree structure using Rust's atomic reference counting smart pointer (<code class=\"language-text\">Arc</code>) to share data, so \"copying\" any sub-tree is a very fast <code class=\"language-text\">O(1)</code> operation. The leaves of the tree are chunks of text with a maximum size.</p>\n<p>An example of a <code class=\"language-text\">O(log n)</code> operation is deleting an interval of a <code class=\"language-text\">Rope</code>, which only requires creating a few new nodes that reference the sub-trees to the right and left of the deleted interval, and creating up to two new leaves if the deleted interval doesn't lie on chunk boundaries.</p>\n<p>Obviously <code class=\"language-text\">Rope</code>s will be slower and take more memory than small <code class=\"language-text\">Strings</code> but they have an asymptotic advantage when working with large documents.</p>\n<p>For a deeper look at <code class=\"language-text\">Rope</code>s see the <a href=\"rope_science_00.md\">Rope Science</a> series.</p>\n<h3 id=\"subset\"><a href=\"#subset\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Subset</h3>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"rust\"><pre class=\"language-rust\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"token keyword\">struct</span> Segment <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    len<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> usize<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    count<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> usize<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">pub</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">struct</span> Subset <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">/// Invariant, maintained by `SubsetBuilder`: all `Segment`s have non-zero</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">/// length, and no `Segment` has the same count as the one before it.</span>\n    segments<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> Vec<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>Segment<span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code> structure in <code class=\"language-text\">multiset.rs</code> represents a multi-subset of a string, meaning that every character in the string has a count (often <code class=\"language-text\">0</code>) representing how many times it is in the <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code>. Most of the time this structure is used to represent plain-old subsets and the counts are only ever <code class=\"language-text\">0</code> for something not in the set or <code class=\"language-text\">1</code> for a character in the set. It is primarily used to efficiently represent inserted and deleted regions of a document.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The exact nature of the characters is not central to the CRDT algorithm. It's most convenient for indices to match the representation, so throughout this document \"characters\" are actually counting UTF-8 code units, so for example an emoji would be multiple \"characters\" in this sense.</p>\n<p>It stores this information compactly as a list of consecutive <code class=\"language-text\">Segment</code>s with a <code class=\"language-text\">length</code> and a <code class=\"language-text\">count</code>. This way a <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code> representing 1000 consecutive characters in the middle of a string will only require 3 segments (a 0-count one at the start, a 1-count one in the middle, and another 0-count one at the end). So as <code class=\"language-text\">(len, count)</code> tuples this would look like: <code class=\"language-text\">(n, 0), (1000, 1), (m, 0)</code>.</p>\n<p>The primary reason that <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code>s can have counts greater than <code class=\"language-text\">1</code> is to represent concurrent deletes, for example if two concurrent edits delete the same character, and one of them is undone, subtracting one of the deletes from the <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code> of deleted characters should still leave the character deleted once. For this reason, the <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code>s of deleted characters which are described later have counts that represent how many times each character has been deleted.</p>\n<p>Note that an \"empty\" <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code> where all the characters have count <code class=\"language-text\">0</code> is still represented as a single segment with the length of the base string and count set to <code class=\"language-text\">0</code>. This allows functions using <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code>s to panic if they are used with strings or other <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code>s of the wrong length. This gives a level of dynamic checking that algorithms are using <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code>s correctly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"delta\"><a href=\"#delta\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Delta</h3>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"rust\"><pre class=\"language-rust\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"token keyword\">enum</span> DeltaElement <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">/// Represents a range of text in the base document.

You can think of this as if there is a \"union string\" that contains all the characters that have ever been inserted, with some marked as deleted.</p>\n<p>When we delete or undo, we don't touch the union string, we just change a <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code> (<code class=\"language-text\">deletes_from_union</code>, more on that later) which marks which characters of the union string are deleted. These deleted characters are sometimes called \"tombstones\" both within Xi and the academic CRDT literature.</p>\n<p>If we wanted to go from the \"union string\" to the current text of the document, you'd delete the characters marked in <code class=\"language-text\">deletes_from_union</code> from the union string. The problem is, Xi access the current text <strong>very often</strong>, so this would be an inefficient way to actually store the text for large documents.</p>\n<p>As an optimization, we store the union string as two separate parts: <code class=\"language-text\">text</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">tombstones</code>. The <code class=\"language-text\">text</code> stores the current visible document contents, so it is really fast to access, and <code class=\"language-text\">tombstones</code> stores all the characters that are currently in the <code class=\"language-text\">deletes_from_union</code> set. We still store the <code class=\"language-text\">deletes_from_union</code> set to mark deleted characters. Note that the union string is still used for most indices as a coordinate space for <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code>s like <code class=\"language-text\">deletes_from_union</code>.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of what this looks like:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">union string:       abcdefgh\ndeletes_from_union: -+---+-+\ntext:               acdeg\ntombstones:         bfh</code></pre></div>\n<p>We can now also look at <code class=\"language-text\">deletes_from_union</code> as describing the interleaving of characters from <code class=\"language-text\">text</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">tombstones</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">text:               a cde g\ndeletes_from_union: -+---+-+\ntombstones:          b   f h</code></pre></div>\n<p>The union string is still an important and useful concept because it makes a lot of the operations easier to implement and understand. Almost all explanations will be in terms of the union string, if you want you can largely ignore that fact that it's actually stored as two separate parts. Most operations are done in terms of the union string and then at the very end they shuffle some things around between the current <code class=\"language-text\">text</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">tombstones</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"revision\"><a href=\"#revision\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Revision</h3>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"rust\"><pre class=\"language-rust\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"token keyword\">struct</span> Revision <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">/// This uniquely represents the identity of this revision and it stays</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">/// the same even if it is rebased or merged between devices.</span>\n    rev_id<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> RevId<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">/// The largest undo group number of any edit in the history up to this</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">/// point.

Typing a character into a Xi document will create a new <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code> with a <code class=\"language-text\">Contents::Edit</code> with an empty <code class=\"language-text\">deletes</code> subset and an <code class=\"language-text\">inserts</code> subset containing the character inserted.</p>\n<p>They can also represent more complex things like selecting multiple ranges of text using multiple cursors (which Xi supports) and then pasting. This would result in a <code class=\"language-text\">Contents::Edit</code> with an <code class=\"language-text\">inserts</code> subset containing multiple separate segments of pasted characters, and a <code class=\"language-text\">deletes</code> subset containing the multiple ranges of previous text that were replaced.</p>\n<p>Note that the <code class=\"language-text\">inserts</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">deletes</code> <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code>s are based on the union string from after the <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code> is applied. The fact that the union string includes deleted characters allows insertions and deletions to maintain their position easily in the face of concurrency and undo. For example, say I have the text \"ac\" and I change it to \"abc\", but then undo the first edit leaving \"b\". If I re-do the first edit, Xi needs to know that the \"b\" goes between the two deleted characters. You might be able to think of ways to do this with other coordinates, but it's much easier and less fraught when coordinates only change on insertions instead of insertions, deletions and undo.</p>\n<p>A key property of <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code>s is that they contain all the necessary information to apply them as well as reverse them. This is important both for undo and also for some operations we'll get to later. This is why <code class=\"language-text\">Contents::undo</code> stores the set of toggled groups rather than the new set of undone groups. It's also why it stores a reversible set of changes to the deleted characters (more on those later), this could be found by replaying all of history using the new set of undo groups, but then it would be inefficient to apply and reverse (because it would be proportional to the length of history).</p>\n<h3 id=\"revid--revtoken\"><a href=\"#revid--revtoken\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>RevId &#x26; RevToken</h3>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"rust\"><pre class=\"language-rust\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"token keyword\">pub</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">struct</span> RevId <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// 96 bits has a 10^(-12) chance of collision with 400 million sessions and 10^(-6) with 100 billion.</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// `session1==session2==0` is reserved for initialization which is the same on all sessions.</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// A colliding session will break merge invariants and the document will start crashing Xi.</span>\n    session1<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> u64<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// if this was a tuple field instead of two fields, alignment padding would add 8 more bytes.</span>\n    session2<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> u32<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// There will probably never be a document with more than 4 billion edits</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// in a single session.</span>\n    num<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> u32<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">/// Valid within a session.

The reason the IDs aren't fully random is so that eventually we can delta-compress them and the IDs will take on average 1 bit per revision instead of 128 bits.

Now what does this mean:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code>s are never modified, and their <code class=\"language-text\">Edit</code>s always refer to the union string that existed when they were created. For operations on multiple <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code>s, we have to be able to map coordinates in one's union string to coordinates in another's. We can deal with this by treating <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code>s of inserted characters as coordinate transforms. Since the only difference to the union string is the inserted characters, if we can map the coordinates of a <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code> from one union string to another, we can work with edits from multiple <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code>s together.</p>\n<p>We can do this by \"expanding\" the indices in a <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code> after each insert by the size of that insert, where the inserted characters are the \"transform\". Conceptually if a <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code> represents the set of characters in a string that were inserted by an edit, then it can be used as a transform from the coordinate space before that edit to after that edit by mapping a <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code> of the string before the insertion onto the 0-count regions of the transform <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code>.</p>\n<p>The actual procedure works by iterating over the segments of the transform:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When it encounters a 0-count segment it keeps putting (potentially partial) segments from <code class=\"language-text\">self</code> into the output until it fills its size.</li>\n<li>When it encounters a non-0-count transform segment it outputs a 0-count segment of the same size.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">SubsetBuilder</code> used for the output automatically merges consecutive segments that have the same count. See the diagram below for how this plays out:</p>\n<p><img src=\"img/trans-expand-1.png\" alt=\"transform_expand workings\"></p>\n<p>One example of how this can be used is to find the characters that were inserted by a past <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code> in the coordinates of the current union string instead of the past one:</p>\n<p><img src=\"img/trans-expand-2.png\"

The form this takes is that you can submit <code class=\"language-text\">Delta</code>s to the <code class=\"language-text\">Engine</code> that are based on a revision that is not the current head. For example a plugin can get the text at a revision, make an edit and submit it along with the <code class=\"language-text\">RevToken</code> it is based on, but by that time there might have been new edits. That's not a problem since <code class=\"language-text\">edit_rev</code> can accept an arbitrary past <code class=\"language-text\">base_rev</code>.</p>\n<p>This operation has a number of stages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Use the <code class=\"language-text\">Delta::factor</code> helper to split the given <code class=\"language-text\">delta</code> into <code class=\"language-text\">ins_delta</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">deletes</code>. This helper returns an <code class=\"language-text\">InsertDelta</code> containing only the inserts and a <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code> based on the text (before the inserts) containing the deleted characters. When you see \"delta\" from now on, it refers to both pieces.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use <code class=\"language-text\">Engine::deletes_from_union_for_index</code> to work backwards from the present to find the <code class=\"language-text\">deletes_from_union</code> at the time of the base revision: <code class=\"language-text\">deletes_at_rev</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transform the delta to be based on the union string at the time of <code class=\"language-text\">base_rev</code> rather than the <code class=\"language-text\">text</code> at the time of <code class=\"language-text\">base_rev</code>. This makes later transformations easier.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">deletes</code> are transformed using <code class=\"language-text\">Subset::transform_expand</code> to expand the indices to include the characters that weren't in the text the <code class=\"language-text\">deletes</code> was based on.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ins_delta</code> is transformed using the similar <code class=\"language-text\">InsertDelta::transform_expand</code> helper. The thing is, with inserts it is ambigous if deleted characters between the same two characters in <code class=\"language-text\">text</code> should be placed before or after characters inserted in the same place.</p>\n<p>This comes into play with arbitrary undo, where if we have \"abc\", we delete \"b\", and then insert to get \"azc\", then undo the deletion of \"b\", should we get \"abzc\" or \"azbc\"? We decided to put the inserts after the deletes, so we would get \"abzc\", but it's not important.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transform the delta to be based on the current head revision's union string instead of <code class=\"language-text\">base_rev</code>'s union string.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is done by looping over every <code class=\"language-text\">Edit</code> <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code> since <code class=\"language-text\">base_rev</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">transform_expand</code>-ing both the <code class=\"language-text\">ins_delta</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">deletes</code> by the inserted characters.</li>\n<li>But again we have the problem of whether we put the <code class=\"language-text\">ins_delta</code> inserts before or after inserts in the same place since then. For this we use the <code class=\"language-text\">priority</code> field of <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code>. The <code class=\"language-text\">priority</code> of the incoming edit we're transforming is compared with the <code class=\"language-text\">priority</code> of the inserts we're transforming it by, and they're ordered in ascending order of priority.</li>\n<li>Each concurrent plugin has a different <code class=\"language-text\">priority</code> and they are useful for expressing what we expect concurrent edits to do. For example inserted auto-indentation should come before new user edits, but matched brackets should come after concurrent user edits, we can set the <code class=\"language-text\">priority</code> of the plugins to get this behavior. In the case of concurrent edits by the same plugin on different synced devices we break ties by session ID.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">Subset::transform_expand</code> the <code class=\"language-text\">deletes</code> to apply to the head union string after <code class=\"language-text\">ins_delta</code> is applied instead of before. This matches the meaning of <code class=\"language-text\">inserts</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">deletes</code> in <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code>, whereas <code class=\"language-text\">Delta::factor</code> gives them to us based on the same string. We <code class=\"language-text\">transform_expand</code> a <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code> by an <code class=\"language-text\">InsertDelta</code> by first using the <code class=\"language-text\">InsertDelta::inserted_subset</code> helper to get a <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code> of the post-insert string designating which characters were inserted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transform the <code class=\"language-text\">ins_delta</code> to be based on the head <code class=\"language-text\">text</code> instead of the union string. Now that we've done all the transformation, we can commit it, and since inserts can only affect the <code class=\"language-text\">text</code> we can use <code class=\"language-text\">Subset::transform_shrink</code> and know that only <code class=\"language-text\">Copy</code> regions of the <code class=\"language-text\">InsertDelta</code> will be collapsed so that the indices of inserted segments can be applied to <code class=\"language-text\">text</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Apply the <code class=\"language-text\">ins_delta</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">text</code> using <code class=\"language-text\">Delta::apply</code> and also <code class=\"language-text\">transform_expand</code> <code class=\"language-text\">deletes_from_union</code> to include the newly inserted characters.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Now that we've applied the inserts, we just need to apply the deletions. But wait! What if the undo group of this edit was undone between <code class=\"language-text\">base_rev</code> and now? The edit might already be undone, in which case the <code class=\"language-text\">deletes</code> shouldn't apply and the inserted characters should be deleted.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We solve this by checking if our undo group is currently undone and if it is we set <code class=\"language-text\">to_delete</code> to the inserted characters, and otherwise set it to <code class=\"language-text\">deletes</code>.</li>\n<li>Then we compute a new <code class=\"language-text\">deletes_from_union</code> by using <code class=\"language-text\">Subset::union</code> to delete the characters in <code class=\"language-text\">to_delete</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We use a helper called <code class=\"language-text\">shuffle</code> which is like (and uses) <code class=\"language-text\">shuffle_tombstones</code> but it updates both the <code class=\"language-text\">text</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">tombstones</code> from corresponding to an old <code class=\"language-text\">deletes_from_union</code> to a new one. It \"shuffles\" characters between <code class=\"language-text\">text</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">tombstones</code> as necessary so that their new state corresponds to the new <code class=\"language-text\">deletes_from_union</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And that's it, after that we just package up the inserted and deleted characters into a <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code> and add it to the list of <code class=\"language-text\">revs</code> in <code class=\"language-text\">Engine</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"rust\"><pre class=\"language-rust\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"token comment\">/// Returns a tuple of a new `Revision` representing the edit based on the</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">/// current head, a new text `Rope`, a new tombstones `Rope` and a new `deletes_from_union`.</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">fn</span> <span class=\"token function\">mk_new_rev</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span><span class=\"token keyword\">self</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> new_priority<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> usize<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> undo_group<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> usize<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        base_rev<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> RevToken<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> delta<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> Delta<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>RopeInfo<span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">-></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>Revision<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> Rope<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> Rope<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> Subset<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> ix <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">self</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">find_rev_token</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>base_rev<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">expect</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"base revision not found\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// 1. split</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>ins_delta<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> deletes<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> delta<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">factor</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// 2.

The CRDT merge operation that allows peer-to-peer syncing of edits in a conflict-free eventually-consistent way. It takes <code class=\"language-text\">self</code> and another instance of <code class=\"language-text\">Engine</code> and incorporates any changes which that <code class=\"language-text\">Engine</code> has into <code class=\"language-text\">self</code>.</p>\n<p>It does this by finding changes which the other <code class=\"language-text\">Engine</code> has but <code class=\"language-text\">self</code> doesn't and doing a whole bunch of transformations so that those edits can be appended directly on to the end of <code class=\"language-text\">self</code>'s list of <code class=\"language-text\">revs</code>. The append-only nature of merge preserves the ability for operations like <code class=\"language-text\">Engine::delta_rev_head</code> to work, and allows future optimizations of how things are persisted.</p>\n<p>The fact that, even in a merge, <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code>s are only ever appended leads to the interesting fact that two peers (Separate devices/engines that share state my merging) can have <code class=\"language-text\">Engine</code>s that represent the same document contents and history, but where the <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code>s are in a totally different order. This is fine though because the <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code> ids allow us to compare the identity of two <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code>s even if their <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code>s are different due to transforms, and undo groups allow us to maintain and manipulate undo history order separately from CRDT history order.</p>\n<p>In practice the order of the <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code> history will tend to be very similar between peers. Any edit that occurs while another edit is visible on screen (present in this peer's <code class=\"language-text\">Engine</code>) will never be re-ordered before that visible edit. Thus if there are no concurrent edits made on devices that sync with each other by merging, the devices will end up with the same <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code> history.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> As of the time this was written, Xi's <code class=\"language-text\">merge</code> implementation does not support undo operations, and will panic if one is encountered. We plan to fix this and expect that the structure of the merge operation will stay the same, just with more cases. So for the rest of this description, presume <code class=\"language-text\">Edit</code>s are the only type of <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"base-and-common-revisions\"><a href=\"#base-and-common-revisions\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Base and common revisions</h4>\n<p>An important part of merging is figuring out which revisions the two sides have in common. These common revisions are found as two parts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The \"base\": A prefix of the same length of both histories such that the set of revisions in both prefixes is the same.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Note that they aren't necessarily in the same order, just all shared. That's because all indices are relative to the union string, which is the same regardless of the order of the revisions that created it.</li>\n<li>We ignore everything in this prefix, so the longer it is the faster the merge runs, but a length of 0 is perfectly fine and in fact at the time this was written, that's what Xi uses.</li>\n<li>Ideally this should be the longest prefix length such that the set of revisions in the prefix is equal in both histories, and we plan on using this later as an important optimization.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The \"common\" revisions: After the base, some revisions on each side will be shared by both sides. The common revisions are the intersection of the two revision sets after the base.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Note that the common revisions aren't necessarily in the same positions or order on each side.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"img/merge-intro.png\" alt=\"CRDT Merge Flow Example\"></p>\n<p>If you're wondering how you can end up with common revisions not in the base, and in different positions and ordering, it's rare, but it can happen under high levels of asynchrony. These cases can occur even with only two peers.</p>\n<p>See the example sequence below, where the boxes represent revisions, and the arrows represent merges. The red arrow with its two sides illustrated below it, shows such a tricky merge.</p>\n<p>This example isn't meant to show a networking scenario, just a legal sequence of applying operations on two CRDT instances. These scenarios can be caused by asynchrony of the network, but exactly how depends on the syncing topology and ordering guarantees, some ways of using <code class=\"language-text\">merge</code> may require 3 peers to trigger a case like this in real use.</p>\n<p><img src=\"img/merge-common-diff-3.png\" alt=\"CRDT merge common in different order\"></p>\n<p>The first two steps of the <code class=\"language-text\">merge</code> operation are to find the base index and common revision set.\nAs of writing these are both the easiest possible correct representations, and not the fastest ones, but we plan on optimizing soon.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"rust\"><pre class=\"language-rust\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"token comment\">/// Find an index

revisions on each side. We can realize this by transforming and reordering all the new revisions on each side after all of the common revisions.</p>\n<p>We can safely use transforms to reorder two revisions if neither of the revisions depends on the other. A revision depends on all the revisions that were in the <code class=\"language-text\">Engine</code> at the time <code class=\"language-text\">Engine::edit_rev</code> was called. We know that a new revision can't depend on a common revision after it, because the append-only nature means that ordering couldn't occur. Furthermore, the common revision can't depend on the new revision, because by definitions the other peer has the common revision but not the new revision, and merges never merge a revision but not its dependencies. Thus, even without explicit dependency information, we know we can reorder all the new revisions on each side after all the common revisions.</p>\n<p>Note that though it's nice to think about it as reordering the histories, really we just need to compute the transformed new revisions, transforming each new revision to be based on all common revisions after it. See the \"computed\" and \"taken to next step\" annotations of the diagram below, they are what <code class=\"language-text\">rearrange</code> returns, note that transformed operations are marked with a prime tick but they maintain their ID.</p>\n<p><img src=\"img/merge-rearrange.png\" alt=\"CRDT merge rearrange\"></p>\n<p>We do the rearranging by working from the end of the list of revisions to the beginning. We build up a <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code> representing all the characters that were added to the union string by the common revisions after each point. Starting with the identity transformation (an entirely 0-count <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code>), whenever we encounter a common revision we add the characters it inserts to the transform. When we encounter a new revision we <code class=\"language-text\">transform_expand</code> its inserts and deletes by the transform <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code> and add it to the output <code class=\"language-text\">Vec</code>. Then we <code class=\"language-text\">transform_shrink</code> the transform <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code> by the characters inserted in the new revision, because we only want to fast-forward new revisions over common revisions after them, not new revisions after them.</p>\n<p>That was likely too imprecise and hard to follow, so here's an example diagram and the code:</p>\n<p><img src=\"img/merge-rearrange-example.png\" alt=\"CRDT merge rearrange example\"></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"rust\"><pre class=\"language-rust\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"token comment\">/// Returns the operations in `revs` that don't have their `rev_id` in</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">/// `base_revs`, but modified so that they are in the same order but based on</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">/// the `base_revs`.

appending the <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code>s, we also have to update the <code class=\"language-text\">text</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">tombstones</code> of <code class=\"language-text\">self</code> to correspond with those new revisions. In <code class=\"language-text\">Engine::edit_rev</code> we transform an <code class=\"language-text\">InsertDelta</code> until we can apply it to the text, but when merging we don't have any <code class=\"language-text\">Delta</code>s. Additionally, the operation for resolving the order of concurrent insertions based on priority is <code class=\"language-text\">Delta::transform_expand</code> and we don't have an equivalent for <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code> (<code class=\"language-text\">Subset::transform_expand</code> does a slightly different thing).</p>\n<p>There's two possible approaches:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Transform the new revisions from <code class=\"language-text\">other</code> and append them, using a newly written equivalent of <code class=\"language-text\">Delta::transform_expand</code> for <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code>s. Then work through the resulting histories to figure out what characters we need to add to the <code class=\"language-text\">text</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">tombstones</code>, and where. We think it may be easier to support undo and incremental Ledger updating with this approach, and we plan on switching eventually, but for now it's not what we chose first.</li>\n<li>Create some <code class=\"language-text\">Delta</code>s! We can turn the new revisions from <code class=\"language-text\">other</code> into a different representation that encodes the <code class=\"language-text\">inserts</code> as an <code class=\"language-text\">InsertDelta</code> so that we can transform them using <code class=\"language-text\">Delta::transform_expand</code> and eventually apply them to the <code class=\"language-text\">text</code> of <code class=\"language-text\">self</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can create these <code class=\"language-text\">DeltaOp</code>s by working backwards from the end of the <code class=\"language-text\">rearrange</code>d new revisions from <code class=\"language-text\">other</code> and keeping track of all the characters they insert in a <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code> using <code class=\"language-text\">Subset::transform_union</code>. Then for each revision we can use <code class=\"language-text\">shuffle_tombstones</code> to extract a <code class=\"language-text\">Rope</code> of all the inserted characters, and then use <code class=\"language-text\">Delta::synthesize</code> to create a <code class=\"language-text\">Delta</code> from our <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code> of inserts to the inserts <code class=\"language-text\">Subset</code> from the previous iteration (one step forward in time since we're iterating backwards). This gives us a <code class=\"language-text\">Delta</code> inserting the new characters from this <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code>, which we can bundle into a <code

through the transforms. The helper for this is named <code class=\"language-text\">rebase</code> since it's analogous to a <code class=\"language-text\">git rebase</code>.</p>\n<p>Basically, for every <code class=\"language-text\">DeltaOp</code> from <code class=\"language-text\">other</code>, we:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">Delta::transform_expand</code> it by each transform from <code class=\"language-text\">self</code>.</li>\n<li>Update the transforms for the next round so they include the <code class=\"language-text\">DeltaOp</code>s inserts, and so effectively they become part of the base for both sides.</li>\n<li>Apply the <code class=\"language-text\">DeltaOp</code> to the <code class=\"language-text\">text</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">tombstones</code></li>\n<li>Create a <code class=\"language-text\">Revision</code> from it and append it to the history.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This procedure works iteratively starting with the results of <code class=\"language-text\">compute_transforms</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">compute_deltas</code>. Every iteration it takes the first <code class=\"language-text\">DeltaOp</code>, transforms it and applies it to the text, and updates all the transforms so that it is effectively in the base of both sides. See the diagrams below of an initial state, the operations performed in the first iteration, and the state after the first iteration. You can refer to the code further below to see how they align.</p>\n<p><img src=\"img/merge-rebase-initial.png\" alt=\"CRDT merge rebase initial state\">\n<img src=\"img/merge-rebase-trace.png\"
