Even so, it might be\ninteresting to experiment with new front-ends other than the official\nCocoa one. This document captures the protocol as it exists (and\nshould be updated as it changes).</p>\n<p>The front-end starts the core process and communicates to it through\nstdin and stdout. The outer layer is based heavily on <a href=\"http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification\">JSON-RPC\n2</a>, communicating over stdin and\nstdout, with messages encoded in UTF-8 and terminated in newlines.\nHowever, there are two differences. Most importantly, the protocol is\npeer-to-peer rather than defining strict server and client roles; both\npeers can send RPC's to the other. To reflect that it is not exactly\nJSON-RPC 2, the \"jsonrpc\" parameter is missing.</p>\n<p>A mixture of synchronous and asynchronous RPC's is used. Most editing\ncommands are sent as asynchronous RPC's, with the expectation that\nthe core will send an (also asynchronous) <code class=\"language-text\">update</code> RPC with the\nupdated state.</p>\n<p>When the front-end quits, it closes the stdin pipe, and the core\nis expected to quit silently.</p>\n<p>The protocol is currently not versioned, as there is only one\nofficial front-end, and it is distributed along with the back-end;\nboth should change in lock step. That may well change if and when\nthere are other front-ends developed independently, in which case a\nsimple version negotiation at startup will support a small window of\nversions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"first-steps\"><a href=\"#first-steps\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>First steps</h3>\n<p>When a frontend is initialized, the first thing it does is launch and connect to\nthe core. Currently, the core is always run as a process, although we expect at\nsome point it could be run in the client process as a library.</p>\n<p>After establishing a connection with the core, the client sends the\n<a href=\"#client_started\"><code class=\"language-text\">client_started</code></a> RPC. Core will respond by notifying the\nclient of some initial state, such as a list of available themes. The client\nthen normally sends a <a href=\"#new_view\"><code class=\"language-text\">new_view</code></a> request; when it receives\na response it can begin sending editing operations against that view.</p>\n<h3 id=\"additional-resources\"><a href=\"#additional-resources\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Additional Resources</h3>\n<p>This document is not always perfectly up to date.
