A good heuristic would be to preserve the scrolled position of the cursor relative to the top of the window. Another tricky aspect is ordering the sequence async rewraps - you’d want to do what’s on the screen first, for immediate update, then the segment from the start of the screen back to the nearest hard break before it, then maybe work backward to the beginning of the buffer, then from the bottom of the visible region to the end of the buffer.
