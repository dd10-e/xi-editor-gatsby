Everyone is welcome to\nparticipate in review; review is an excellent time to ask questions about\ncode or design decisions that you don't understand.</p>\n<p>All pull requests must be approved by an appropriate reviewer before they\nare merged. For bug fixes and smaller changes, this can be anyone who has\ncommit rights to the repo in question; larger changes (changes which add a\nfeature, or significantly change behaviour or API) should also be approved by\na maintainer.</p>\n<p>Before being merged, a change must pass\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration\">CI</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"responsibilites-of-the-approving-reviewer\"><a href=\"#responsibilites-of-the-approving-reviewer\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Responsibilites of the approving reviewer</h4>\n<p>If you approve a change, it is expected that you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>understand what the change is trying to do, and how it is doing it</li>\n<li>have manually built and tested the change, to verify it works as intended</li>\n<li>believe the change generally matches the idioms, formatting rules,\nand overall coding style of the relevant repo</li>\n<li>are ready and able to help resolve any problems that may be introduced by\nmerging the change.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a PR is made by a contributor who has write access to the repo in question,\nthey are responsible for merging/rebasing the PR after it has been approved;\notherwise it will be merged by the reviewer.</p>\n<p>If a patch adds or modifies behaviour that is observable in the client,\nthe reviewer should build the patch and verify that it works as expected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"after-submitting-your-change\"><a href=\"#after-submitting-your-change\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>After submitting your change</h3>\n<p>You've done all this, and submitted your patch. What now?</p>\n<p><em>Read other PRs</em>. If you're waiting for a review, it's likely that other\npull requests are waiting for review as well. This can be a good time\nto go and take a look at what other work is happening in the project;\nand if another PR has review comments, it might provide a clue to the\ntype of feedback you might expect.</p>\n<p><em>Patience</em>. As a general goal, we try to respond to all pull requests\nwithin a few days, and to do preliminary review within a week, but we\ndon't always succeed. If you've opened a PR and haven't heard from\nanyone, feel free to comment on it, or stop by the Zulip channel, to ask\nif anyone has had a chance to take a look. It's very possible that it's\nbeen lost in the shuffle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-more-involved\"><a href=\"#getting-more-involved\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Getting more involved</h2>\n<p>If you are participating in the xi-editor project, you may receive\nadditional privileges:</p>\n<p><em>Organization membership</em>: If you are regularly making contributions\nto a xi project, in any of the forms outlined above, we will be happy to\nadd you to the xi-editor organization, which will give you the ability\nto do things like add labels to issues and view active projects.</p>\n<p><em>Contributor</em>: If you are regularly making substantive contributions\nto a specific xi project, we will be happy to add you as a contributor\nto the repo in question.
