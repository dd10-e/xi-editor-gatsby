The fact is, cursor movement just doesn't commute in any meaningful way with edit operations dependent on cursor position.

In this model, instead of each insert being annotated with just a unique id of the actor, it's annotated with a tuple of (priority, unique id). We can sort these in lexicographical order, so the CRDT goal of ensuring a consistent order is still met. But by assigning appropriate priorities, we can now get the edits in the correct order. In particular, give \"....\" the priority \"before cursor\", \"bar\" the priority \"just before cursor\" (which is the default priority of all characters inserted from the keyboard), and \"\\n\" the priority \"after cursor\". Insert all of these strings at the same location, and voila, you get the desired answer. Further, you can include the cursor position itself in the ordering logic, resulting in it naturally landing after \"bar\" without it having to be explicitly positioned. I will implement exactly this, because figuring out the correct position of the cursor after a complex sequence of undo/redo and other edits is otherwise not trivial.`), React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n    name: \"p\",\n    components: components\n  }, `The semantics of conflict-free datatypes are subtly different from their sequential counterparts. There are certain things you can easily do in the sequential world that don't work conflict-free.

I think you'll see a lot more instances of this general pattern as CRDT becomes more popular.`), React.createElement(MDXTag, {\n    name: \"p\",\n    components: components\n  }, `Thanks to Yigit Boyar for a lunch conversation which helped me clarify many of these thoughts.`));\n});"},"excerpt":"(originally written 11 May 2016) In today's post, we'll deep dive into a very specific problem (namely, the design of an asynchronous plugin that does indentation) and then try to derive some more general lessons from it.
